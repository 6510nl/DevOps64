     koffietijd! semi-live from starbucks the bank in amsterdam the netherlands we would like to send you a big hello and wish you a steaming hot welcome to the 30th birthday of the commodore sx-64 (with extra sugar)! we have gathered in this old bank building to celebrate this milestone - have a $c0ffee and scare off lame modern multicore hipsters with their fancy portable thingies by bringing out our robust luggable executive sx-64s - the equipment of choice for the self-conscious commodore user on the road - thirty years after launch sx-64s are right here - used by decision makers and globetrotting demosceners worldwide - ikilledher here tapping these extremely portable keys - sending out some lukewarm greetings to +you+! i hope to meet you all in the big room during the heavy data storm next month - now i will quickly hand over this freely movable keyboard to berry at the other end of the hall (wow! that curly cable is loooong!) who made this party demo - bombs away! (berry) this started out as a little gimmick on c64 (dot) berrydejager (dot) com - and now sx-64 owners are gathering all over the globe - this is insane and it shows that the best computer ever made up till now and many centuries into the future still rules - jack tramiel has started his computers for the masses not the classes-movement and by organising this event we are showing that he was right! so let us all make more demoscene productions and enjoy these already 30 year old work horses - special thanks to katie docherty at starbucks for forcefully restraining mesmerized suits from the community table and supplying $c0ffee - and loving c64 sceners worldwide doing so - also thanks to all the guys on ircnet c-64 for helping eachother out on technical challenges - like figuring out the sx-64 detection - and a special thanks to ikilledher and ddw for the mental help and teaming up with me on www (dot) 6510 (dot) nl - follow us on twitter at 6510nl - signing off to pack this release and publish it on csdb    --- thanks ---
